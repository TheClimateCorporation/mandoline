  "This implements a caching index store and a caching chunk store.

   The caching index store attempts to speed up writes by keeping all
   but the final index state local. Because there is a lot of
   read-then-write-then-read behavior with the index, this potentially
   saves a tremendous amount of network I/O.

   The caching chunk store attempts to keep a small cache of
   heavily-used chunks in-memory. Because most physically-realistic
   datasets are highly-redundant, the bulk of the indices point to a
   tiny cluster of chunks. Maintaining a local cache of these chunks
   can save a tremendous amount of network I/O during reads, since
   most queries are dominated by requests for the same chunk."

;; NOTE: ONLY USE CachingIndex FOR WRITING!
;;
;; In order to optimize for write performance, this index store does
;; *not* implement a read-through cache. If you attempt to use this
;; store for reading, you will get what appears to be a completely
;; empty index.
;;
;;
;; NOTE: CACHING FOR DISTRIBUTED WRITERS IS NOT SUPPORTED!
;;
;; This implementation of flush-index assumes that there is only one
;; machine performing a write. Using this store to perform
;; distributed writes will almost certainly result in corrupted
;; indices.
